Q.Why are item containers used in Scrapy?
The main goal in scraping is to extract structured data from unstructured sources, typically, web pages.
Scrapy spiders can return the extracted data as Python dicts. While convenient and familiar, Python dicts
lack structure: it is easy to make a typo in a field name or return inconsistent data, especially in a larger
project with many spiders.

To define common output data format Scrapy provides the Item class. Item objects are simple
containers used to collect the scraped data. They provide a dictionary-like API with a convenient
syntax for declaring their available fields.

Scrapy Items are very similar to Django models
